Clarifications:
1] GPS guides often turn out to be inaccurate and misleading. Esp in the 3rd world context where the streets are narrow and
the buildings are tall making it even more difficult to track.
2] Google Maps not labelled accurately.
3] Apps require GPS/GPRS. Some people who cant read maps and directions well but can understand well in terms of landmarks and natural conversation.
4] Those that dont require GPS/GPRS are high on storage.
