\section{Relevant Works}
\cite{zlatev:semantics} worked on the cognitive linguistic research in spatial semantics and provided basic theoretical concepts for understanding it. Ever since then, there has been growing trend to understand natural language (NL) descriptions. The research has moved towards understanding unrestricted NL in current works (\cite{Kordjamshidi:labelling, matuszek:following, tellex:language}). However, most of these works make use of map-assisted learning and/or vision based understanding (\cite{kollar:robotic,levit:interpretation,macmahon:walk}), our methodology makes use of no external resources but the machine learning tools \cite{fei:locative} to identify place names and the associated prepositional phrases (\textit{dle}). The spatial triplets are then identified by a case-based reasoning method, in whole which takes away the need of an annotated training dataset (which are usually noisy or biased) and/or a detailed map.
