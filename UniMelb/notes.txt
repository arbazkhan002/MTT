1] Tutored freshmen for an introductory course in C programming. Conducted weekly lectures and co-ordinated lab sessions for a class of strength 38. Worked with a team of 8 student tutors and 4 faculty tutors to provide wilful contribution in preparing questions and solutions for quizzes, semester exams and mentoring advanced track students for course projects.
2] Designated the post of Event Co-ordinator for Cricket in Udghosh'10, led a team of 12 volunteers and worked diligently to effectuate a successful Cricket tournament even in devastatingly affecting regular rains. 

As an 8 week intern at the University of Melbourne (Australia), I worked on the natural language processing task of extracting spatial information from place descriptions. The internship formed an integral part of a larger project "tell us where"(www.telluswhere.net). Hence, it was required to study the existing code base of a NL parser which recognizes the place names. Using shallow parsing, dependency parsing and plausible heurisitcs, the parser was extended to extract spatial triplets. Comprehensive investigation of errors and limitations was then performed on a broad corpus of 1858 place descriptions and a set of 4 campus descriptions. The results indicated a recall of 0.8 in triplet extraction barring the cases of interpreting spatial motion. The work was accepted as a research paper in the prestigious ACM SIGSPATIAL's Workshop. Given, the short duration of 8 weeks, it turned out as praiseworthy effort acknowledged by all the associates.
