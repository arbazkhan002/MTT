The Parkville Melbourne Uni campus is located just north of the city, with the buildings mainly concentrated between Royal Parade and Swanston Street, and Grattan St and Tin Alley. The engineering buildings are largely along Grattan St near South Lawn.  Union house (full of food outlets) is located towards the centre of the campus, next to the old arts building. The main entry is in front of the tram super stop on Swanston St. Essentially the main campus shape looks like a square with a semi-circle attached to the top. Beyond tin alley is mainly uni colleges. South of Grattan Street is University Square, which leads down to the Law Building (very tall) and the Spot (named for its facade). It is a large sprawling campus that many people get lost in at first!
