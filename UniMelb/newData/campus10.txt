There are several entrances that can access the main campus of Melbourne Uni. The easiest way is to jump on the tram on Swanstone Street and then get off at the terminal station. The Main campus lies on the left hand side. The first modern building you will see is the Sydney Myer Center and there is a main road and entrance just beside the Center. Go along the main road, it will lead you to the Wilson Hall at the end of the road. If you turn right, climb up the stairs and follow the path, it will lead you to Union House where you can find restaurants and uni clubs. If you turn left and then climb up those tiny stairs, it will lead you to the southern lawn where some uni activities may take place there. If you keep going straight and walk down the stairs, it will lead you to the main library of uni. Beside the library is the co-op bookstore where you can buy your textbook.
