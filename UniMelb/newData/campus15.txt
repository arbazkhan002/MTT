The Parkville campus is made up of two sections, a part at the south containing the law, commerce and business buildings; this is near the Haymarket roundabout, and separated by a distance of around a hundred metres to the main section of the Parkville campus. This main part is bounded by Grattan st to the south, Swanston to the east, Elizabeth to the west and the university colleges to the north. Starting from the east at Swanston st is the main tram stop. Heading further west are the physics and mathematics (richard berry) buildings to the north, Sydney myer asia centre towards the middle, and other arts buildings. Further west, from the north, are the science (chemistry, biology) faculty buildings and to the south are the engineering faculty buildings. Towards the middle of the campus are the more general buildings, including the union house, student administration and a number of arts buildings. South of this is South lawn, and to the west of the lawns are the Baillieu and medical libraries. On the western end of the campus exist the health/biological and food sciences buildings, with the Botany building at the north, biology and immunology buildings towards the middle and the main medical building at the south western corner of the campus.
