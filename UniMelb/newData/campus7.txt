I will suggest my friend to take the tram to the University of Melbourne. The start could be set in the tram stop of Finders Street Station or Melbourne Central Station on Swanston Street. Take any tram along the Swanston Street to the north, it will be easy to find the campus by the buildings with marks of the University of Melbourne. After arriving, I will suggest him or she to take a look at the department and the historical buildings in the campus. Take a walk on South Lawn then have a meal in Union house or Lygon Street.
