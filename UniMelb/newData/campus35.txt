The campus is located in the area north of Grattan St and between Swanston St and Royal parade (the extension of Elizabeth st).  The campus is a collection of many buildings of differing styles  constructed over the last 150 years.  Only a few are more than 8 stories high.  There are few open spaces on the campus (except on and around the sports ovals at the north end of the campus). However, there is one large lawn area about two hundred meters north of the main Grattan st entrance.  This serves as  useful central focus point for the campus.  [I would draw a map]
