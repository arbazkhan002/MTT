dear friend here is where you will go for your enrolment. when you are coming via swanston street stop at melbourne university tram station. cross to the east side, you will see sydney myer bldg and a small gatehouse. walk on the road(monash rd) for about 100m past alice hoy bldg to the left then at the end go left and straight to a 4 level stair then go right to a small alley way. at your left you will see the eng'g workshop bldg, and in front is a signpost to mechanical eng'g. go in that alley and about 10m to your right is a path for disabled persons, walk that way and you will be at the back door of the eng'g student center. there is where you can inquire about anything including obtaining a campus map.
