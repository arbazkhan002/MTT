The universuty is so large and has many buildings. At first, if you get off at the tram stop 1 on Swanston street, you can see the main gate of the university. And then go straight along the road. When you see a building at the end of the road, turn to the right and you can see union house where there are a few restaurants and facilities. Also go straight along the way and then you can see playground for basketball, track, and gym including swimming pool.  In the middle of the uni there is big grass where you can take a rest and chat with. It was surrounded by library and other buildings.
