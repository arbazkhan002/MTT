The campus to start off is quite confusing but the major reference point you have to remember is south lawn which is situated in about the middle of the campus. To the west of this you have the Baillieu Library, to the north the old quad (really old english style building), to the east a big hall and to the south is grattan street. Swanston st borders the east side of the campus and is where the main tram stop is. If you want food and are currently on South Lawn go trough the old quad to the north, and keeping heading north until you get to a union house. The medical building is at the south west corner and engineering south east.
