There are several gates around the campus to enter. As far as I know near each gate there is a map with description so that you can easily find the buildings and where you are located. If you divide the campus in four blocks, the Engineering buildings are mostly located in the bottom right block. The union house which is located in North part of the campus, beside the sport centre provide you the maps and people there will help you to find the places.
