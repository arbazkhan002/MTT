It's pretty big, and the buildings are a bit haphazard in their placement. As you come up Swanston St, the ugly block on the corner is the Arts Centre. If you walk down past it- along grattan st if you don't want to get lost, in between the buildings for the scenic route, with a good coffee stop along the way- there is the 1888 building, which is pretty. Then various engineering buildings, then the two towers of the John Medley building. It's always windy there, but up the stairs is South Lawn, which is nice, and from there you'll see the Old Quad. Classics is in there. It's beautiful when the flowers are out. A mecca for wedding photos. Behind that is union house, with all of its amenities and uninspiring food. The architecture building was where there's now that big construction site. That path from Swanston street used to be really nice, actually. There are various other buildings around there- the old towering one that i think is the psychology building? On the other side of union house is the athletics area- running track, gym- and beyond that, the colleges. Walking down alongside all of that, there's the university club, then along Professor's Walk, botany, linguistics, Old Arts, economics, and the less-than beautiful building at the end there is the main library, the Baillieu. Check out the carpark entrance near there though- awesome faux classical statues. Behind that row of buildings are places like the music faculty, and the brain institute.
