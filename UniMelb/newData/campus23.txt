If you walk down Monash Rd. from Swanston street you have the Sydney Myer Asia Centre on your left and the Future Students Information Centre on your right. At the end of Monash Rd. you can either turn left (and end up at a great coffee place), right (to go to the Union Building) or up the stairs straight ahead to get to the South Lawn. If you cross the South Lawn you'll end up at the Baillieu Library and the Coop Bookstore. If you then go right and walk past the Professor's Court, the Babel Building and Botany, you will end up at the university house. If you turn left before Babel and follow the road you will find two more cafes. If you turn right before Babel and walk past the Old Arts Building and through the Old Quadrangle, and then turn left you will be back almost in front of the Union Building.
