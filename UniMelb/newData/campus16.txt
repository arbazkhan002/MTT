Melbourne University is not a big university. You can start your visit at the gate which is John Medley building and you will see WELCOME at the bridge above your horizon. Pass the gate you will see Southern Lawn which is place that students always hang out and I think it it also a awarded design. Keep walking you will see some old buildings, you should spend some time there taking some pictures. Then you will reach the central of the campus, union house. You may wander around but I think there's nothing interesting at all. However, I suggest you to go to Royal Parade via Tin Aly and start to have a tutor along the colleges. These colleges are old and have their own features. When you finish walking you will find the tram station on Swanston where you can catch a tram and go back.
