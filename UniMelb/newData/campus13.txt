There are various entrances to the campus and each entrance will lead you to a different side of the campus and thus a different life in that area. When walking north, do not pass the union house because located behind are the colleges and sports tracks. The west side of the campus holds the library and arts west plus various other buildings. Crossing the lawn you'll meet the east side of the campus which holds Alice Hoy and Sidney Myer Asia Centre, conveniently located along Swanston St; the easiest route to the campus. Buildings and landscapes across the campus are inspired by the British at a time of European settlement, there is a traditional laying out of structures which sends through a conservative feel to the campus, especially with structures close Grattan St, south of the campus.
