the university campus is restricted in a rectangle shape by four main roads, however, some buildings extend over this boundary. Inside these boundaries there are many smaller roads and pathways which can become quite confusing without a map as guidance, there is no straightforward grid type layout. if you are looking for a specific building it will be necessary to have a map or the 'lost on campus' app on your phone, as there aren't very many signs to guide you to your building.
