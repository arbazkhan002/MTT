The Melbourne University Campus is laid out in an appealing manner with easy access to all academic facilities. Old meet new in a fascinating way when buildings stemming as far back as the year 1888 meet new architecture that reflect the more modern and global times we live in. The campus stretches over a substantially large area and the different parts of these premises tend to be connected by way of extensive green spaces and appealing passageways such as the one that connects the Baillieu Library area with the buildings related to the Physics precinct. Sprinkled across the campus are small coffee shops and coffee carts that attract students in need of a well-deserved break.
