the parkvile campus of melbourne uni is a sequare, the southern road is garttan rd, northern road is tin alley, swanston st is at east side, and royal parade is at west. i suppose that you are interesting in engineering faculty, which locates at the south east part of the campus. there are several buildings along with grattan rd, and also the engineering student center which you might wanna pay a visit locates at the same area (south-east part) as well.
