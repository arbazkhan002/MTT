You can enter the main campus by different gates along Royal Parade, Swanston and Grattan Streets. The main entrance is in Grattan street opposite to a square called 'University Square'. You will recognize the main entrance because it's the wider one. From there you could see the 'Welcome to the University of Melbourne' sign to the north, and a view of the CBD to the south.  Once there (facing the 'Welcome'), the buildings on your right are part of the School of Engineering (a building with outdoor stairs, and a red building called 'Old Engineering').  Keep walking straight ahead towards the 'Welcome' sign and go up stairs to find a beautiful landscape with lawns and a 1800 styled building with a tower (Old Arts). When you reach the center of the square there are three paths to choose: -The left path takes you to the Baillieu library, the schools of Arts, Zoology and Botany. If you keep going left behind the library you can find the way to Medicine School and Royal Parade. The main entrance to Medicine is in Grattan Street close to Royal Parade.  -The path in the middle takes you to the Old Arts building and a beautiful old style corridor with an inner camellias' garden, and, beyond that, the Union House. Then you can go through the Union House, keep going north and get to the sporting complex, with a swimming pool, gym and sport fields. Otherwise, you can turn right and get to a small square surrounded by the Administration, Commerce and Student services buildings.  -The path to the right directs to more engineering buildings (electrical and metallurgic, and Old Engineering building again). If you keep walking in that direction, you'll find ERC library (but to find the main entrance you have to find the opposite face of the building). Keep walking in that direction will take you to Swanston street.  Other schools and University units (for example Law) are located around the University Square that I pointed in the first paragraph.
