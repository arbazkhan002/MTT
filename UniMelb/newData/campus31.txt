It's very easy to go around the campus since university's map is all around and you can see it everywhere. Just some quick places worth visiting. First, it is Union house which located at the center of Parkville campus. Second, 1888 building which close to Grattan street on gate 8. Trinity college is a worth visiting place too. Just pass the sport center.
