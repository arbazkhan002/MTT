The campus stretches along three major roads - swanston street in the East, Grattan street South and Royal parade in the West. The campus is on a rectangular block and consist of many different buildings, connected by stairs and walkways.  So entering the campus from the main entrance on Grattan street - opposite of the main entrance are also the newer buildings of Melbourne Uni (the Business and Law School, as well as the faculty of commerce) - the visitor first needs to climb stairs to get onto south lawn and on top of the carpark. Now walking towards the old Arts buildings, the medical school and Baileu library is on the left, the geography and architecture buildings on the left. Reaching the Old Quad, you enter the most beautiful and oldest part of the campus. Unfortunately it is not very big and soon the visitor passes University house and is again surrounded by yellow brick 70s buildings. Ahead now are the sports facilities of University.
