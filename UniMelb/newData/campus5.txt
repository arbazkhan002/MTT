Take any tram going up Swanston St and get off at the Melbourne University stop (it's the one on the right side of the tram, rather than the left). Cross over to the left side of the road and walk down that road in to the campus. At the end of the road turn diagonally right, and walk up the steps. Behind you to your left is Wilson Hall, the old building in front of you to the left is the Old Quad (oldest building on campus) and the orange brick building you see on the other side of the courtyard (or by looking under the arches of the building in front of you) is Union House. This has all of the food shops in it!   Further north of Union House is the oval and the arc of Colleges, but you don't really need to look at them.   The main grassed area is South Lawn, which is just the other side of the row of buildings you just walked past - the Old Quad, Wilson Hall and the others in line with them. You can think of it as South Lawn surrounded by a layer of buildings. You can walk through any of these buildings except Wilson Hall, or follow the rabbit-warren lanes in between the buildings. Just keep walking vaguely south from Union House through the layer of buildings and you'll get there.  From South Lawn if you walk to the exit off to the right you'll come out right in front of the main library, the Baillieu. If instead you walk straight across South Lawn to the southern exit you'll come out right in front of the main Grattan St exit. To your left as you leave South Lawn are the engineering buildings. Anyway, across the other side of Grattan St is University Square with the Law building at the end of the park. Instead of crossing, turn left and walk back to Swanston St. On your left you'll see the really pretty 1888 building.   From the intersection with Swanston St turn left again and head back to the tram stop to go home.
