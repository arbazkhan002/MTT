Dear friend, On the Parkville campus, I and many other people will make their way into the Univiserity via swanston street. generally I enter through the monash road entrance. For classes, we have lots of large buildings so finding your way around can be daunting at first as there are so many small pathways and oddly shaped buildings to navigate your way through. On the plus side there are many gardens to sit and relax in like the system gardens which is away from the crowds of people walking about towards royal parade. On the other hand there is the south lawn which is right in the centre of everything and were most people seem to be. The union house where you can get your food is conveniently just next door to this, after walking through the old arts building which is where many of the lecture are held. the layout at first is hard to internalise to know where you are going but given you will spend a lot of time walking to each class, the landmark buildings and gardens become clues to where you are heading.
