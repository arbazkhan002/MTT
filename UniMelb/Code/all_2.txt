The UoM campus takes up a large area in the north of Carlton. There are many entrances to the campus but the ones you’ll be using most are the main south entrance in Grattan Street, and several ones in Swanston Street to the east. 
Once you enter the campus via the main south entrance there are three main alternative paths that you can use to head north. The central one is up some stairs and through a medium to large sized lawn. This path is distinguishable by the large blue banner with the UoM logo. The path will take you to the heart of the campus, where there is a chapel, some historical buildings and a little to the east, the Union House. 
The Union House is a large building containing many cafes and restaurants, an electronics store and other facilities for students. Near the Union House you can also find a large gym, in the northeastern direction. You can also find NAB and Commonwealth bank branches near the Union House to the west.
The second path available from the south entrance takes you a little bit to the west and then switches to the north, parallel to the first path. Near this cornering point you can occasionally find a crepes stand. From this path you can access other campus buildings, exit the campus from the western entrances/exits and reach the University House by continuing north. 
The third path branches to the east and leads to the Engineering building, which you’ll find on your right hand side and the Old Engineering building which is straight ahead. At this point the main path heads north again, parallel to the first path, but you may continue to the east/northeast, past the Eng. Building to reach the University Library and Swanson Street exits via a series of smaller winding paths. If you choose to take the turn north following the main third path, you will walk past the Wilson hall to your left and eventually reach the Union House to your northwest and the campus center.
