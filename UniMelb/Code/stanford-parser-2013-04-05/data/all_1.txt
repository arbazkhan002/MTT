We're sitting in Baretto's in the Alan Gilbert Building, across Grattan street is one of the medical buildings. Down the hill along Grattan street the new building being constructed is the Peter Doherty Institute and diagonally across the road (Royal Parade) is Melbourne Hospital. In the other direction the open area is University square (there is a carpark underneath) at the city end of University square is the law building. Across Grattan street from University square there is an entrance to the campus, straight ahead is an overpass building and to the right are the various Engineering buildings. The road goes in a big loop around the campus you can either go left towards the Medical buildings or right passed the Engineering buildings then head North (away from University square). One other area you may want to explore is South Lawn which you can get to by going underneath the overpass building directly in front of you when you enter the campus.
