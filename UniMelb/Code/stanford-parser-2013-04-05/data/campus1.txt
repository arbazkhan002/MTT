Imagine a rectangle (vertical length, horizontal width). On the lower left coner of the rectangle would mainly be populated with life sciences departments. On the lower right coner of the rectangle, you would find most engineering and IT departments. The center of the rectangle would be the south lawn (a huge lawn). A bit above the center, you would find Arts and student union.  Add a semi circle on top of the rectangle. That would be all the athletic tracks and sports field.  Add a small rectangle below the initial rectangle. The shared edge is a section of Grattan St that ran across the campus. That small rectangle is where you would find law, and commerce departments.
