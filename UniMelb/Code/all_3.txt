The campus covers a substantial area. In the center are the original “old” buildings that were built when the university first opened many decades ago. These buildings housed the faculty of physics and arts, among others. These buildings can be easily identified by their older style of architecture and brick composition, the concrete archways down each corridor, and the iconic clock tower that can be seen from most parts of the campus. Directly to its south is an open square that acts as an intersection for students to travel from one part of the university to the other. There is a carpark directly under the square. To the West is the Baillieu Library. To the east is the general hall that is used as an examination venue and as a host to other major events like graduation. The Union House is located to the North of the old buildings. The Union House has a cafeteria and also is the hub for most student association activities.  The Engineering departments are located on the South East corner of the campus. If you walk further south of the engineering department, you will reach Grattan Street. Pass the street and walk further down past the public park and you will reach the Law faculty. Most of the  sports-related venues like tennis courts, swimming pools and racetracks are located on the opposite side, that is, to the furthest north of the campus. If you can find your way around these spots you can eventually (& hopefully) orientate yourself to the other buildings you may need to find in the future. If that fails, you can always ask around or use the conveniently placed maps set up around the entire campus.  Finally, if you would like to know more about the hidden gems of quirky spots around campus, the best places for coffee and interesting historical sites, then you are asking the wrong person.  Good luck!
